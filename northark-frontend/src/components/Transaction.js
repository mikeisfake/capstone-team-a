export const Transaction = props => {
  return (
    // not sure how to format these but I hate working with tables so maybe a list??
    // this would be the component for the individual transaction item. Ideally pull transactions from DB and map over them to make this compoennt for each one and pass data as props to this.
    <li className="transaction-item"></li>
  )
}
